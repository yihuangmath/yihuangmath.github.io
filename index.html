    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    
    <p>
        My name is Yi Huang. I'm an assistant professor at the <a href="https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Yau Mathematical Sciences Center</a> based at Tsinghua University (Beijing). Here's my <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_cv.pdf">CV</a>. I received my PhD from the University of Melbourne (17th of December 2014) under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~pnorbury/">Prof. Paul Norbury</a>. I am a geometer/geometric topologist, and much of my work involves using the geometry of hyperbolic surfaces to study Teichm&uuml;ller and moduli space theory.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why did I make this website?</h3>
    
    <p>
         I have fairly broad mathematical interests and I'd love to hear about your work. Who knows, maybe we can collaborate on something!
    </p>

    
    <h3>What have I been up to?</h3>
    
    <p>
        I'm teaching Calculus C2 (for international students) this semester, whilst supervising my student Xiao Chen (I'll put a link here once he makes a website), and mentoring <a href="https://sangsanw.com/">Tee (Sangsan) Warakkagun</a> - a postdoc based at BIMSA! 
    </p>

    <h3>Seminar series?</h3>

    <p>
        Weiyan CHEN, Yi JIANG, Jianfeng LIN and I organise the <a href="seminar.html">YMSC Topology seminar</a> group at the YMSC.
    </p>

    
    
<!--    <h3>What am I reading?</h3>
    
    <p>I'm currently intrigued by geodesic currents, and am reading through chapter IV of Bonahon's thesis as well as his 1988 <em>Inventiones mathematicae</em> paper entitled <em>The geometry of Teichm&uuml;ller space via geodesic currents</em>.
        <ul>
            <li> Kashaev's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0180">paper</a> (put on ArXiv earlier this year) entitled <em>Penner coordinates for closed surfaces</em>. I was sort of hoping that I might be able to build some sort of Penner-type cell-decomposition out of Kashaev's coordinates, but it doesn't seem to be quite so straight-forward. Which stands to reason, because I'm sure that Kashaev would have considered this. In any case, I want to understand his generalisation of the ideal Ptolemy relation. 
            <li><a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_(reading)%20series_the%20geometry%20of%20markoff%20numbers.pdf"><img id="dlicon" src="pictures/dlicon.gif"></a> - I've been wanting to generalise Markoff's theorem for quadratic forms in the context of Paul and my work on Markoff quads. A first step is to try to understand the connect between Markoff triples and quadratic forms. These notes are based on Caroline Series's paper entitled <em>The Geometry of Markoff numbers</em>.</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    
    <h3>Seminar series?</h3>

    <p>
        And here are some seminar series that I'm either currently attending or have attended in the past:
        <ul>
            <li>Algebra-Geometry-Topology (AGT)</li>
            <li>Enumerative Geometry</li>
            <li>Homotopy Theory</li>
            <li>Mirror Symmetry</li>
            <li>NUmber Theory Seminar(NUTS)</li>
            <li>Homotopy Lie Groups</li>
            <li>The Volume Conjecture</li>
            <li>The Weil Conjectures</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
