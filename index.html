    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    
    <p>
        My name is Yi Huang. Last year (17th of December 2014), I received my PhD from the University of Melbourne under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~pnorbury/">A/Prof. Paul Norbury</a>. I am a geometer/geometric topologist, and much of my work involves using the geometry of hyperbolic surfaces to study Teichm&uuml;ller and moduli space theory. <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_moduli%20spaces%20of%20surfaces%20(phd%20thesis).pdf">Here</a>'s my thesis, and <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_cv.pdf">here</a>'s my CV. I'll be starting a postdoc position at the <a href="http://msc.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Yau Mathematical Sciences Center</a> at Tsinghua University (it's in Beijing) at the end of the year.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why did I make this website?</h3>
    
    <p>
         I have fairly broad mathematical interests and I'd love to hear about your work. Who knows, maybe we can collaborate on something!
    </p>

    
    <h3>What have I been up to?</h3>
    
    <p>
        I recently visited a bunch of people in Singapore and Osaka thanks to the Australian Mathematics Society's Lift-Off Travelling Fellowship. I visited <a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattansp/">Prof. Ser Peow Tan</a> and <a href="http://math.uni.lu/schlenker/group.html">Dr. Hengnan Hu</a> at the National University of Singapore and <a href="http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~miyachi/paper.html">A/Prof. Hideki Miyachi</a> at Osaka University. I had a pretty good time learning maths from them, and gave a few seminars about Paul and my <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7089">work on Markoff quads</a> as well as some of my thesis work on crowned hyperbolic surfaces. I'm currently busying myself tutoring at the University of Melbourne, whilst trying to pump out some preprints. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What are my plans?</h3>
    
    <p>
        I've been quite fortunate to receive two travelling awards: the 2014/2015 AustMS Lift-Off Travelling Fellowships and the 2015 AK Head Travelling Scholarship for Mathematical Scientists. I've already used up my Lift-Off Fellowship, and I intend to use my <a href="https://www.science.org.au/node/451521#.VIT1OskmsqM">AK Head Mathematical Sciences</a> to visit <a href="http://www.wiu.edu/cas/math/faculty_staff/faculty/lafountain.php">A/Prof. LaFountain</a> at Western Illinois University as well as <a href="http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~papadop/">Prof. Athanase Papadopoulos</a> and <a href="http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~mcshane/">Prof. Greg McShane</a> in France mid-2015.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What am I reading?</h3>
    
    <p>I'm currently intrigued by geodesic currents, and am reading through chapter IV of Bonahon's thesis as well as his 1988 <em>Inventiones mathematicae</em> paper entitled <em>The geometry of Teichm&uuml;ller space via geodesic currents</em>.
<!--        <ul>
            <li> Kashaev's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0180">paper</a> (put on ArXiv earlier this year) entitled <em>Penner coordinates for closed surfaces</em>. I was sort of hoping that I might be able to build some sort of Penner-type cell-decomposition out of Kashaev's coordinates, but it doesn't seem to be quite so straight-forward. Which stands to reason, because I'm sure that Kashaev would have considered this. In any case, I want to understand his generalisation of the ideal Ptolemy relation. 
            <li><a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_(reading)%20series_the%20geometry%20of%20markoff%20numbers.pdf"><img id="dlicon" src="pictures/dlicon.gif"></a> - I've been wanting to generalise Markoff's theorem for quadratic forms in the context of Paul and my work on Markoff quads. A first step is to try to understand the connect between Markoff triples and quadratic forms. These notes are based on Caroline Series's paper entitled <em>The Geometry of Markoff numbers</em>.</li>
        </ul>

                                    <style type="text/css">
