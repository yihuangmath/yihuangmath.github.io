    <h3>Crack-pot ideas</h3>
    
    <p>
        Here're some totally crack-pot ideas that I'd like to try:
    </p>
    
    <h4>Explicitly constructing holomorphic differentials</h2>
    
    <p> In this short <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_holomorphic%20differentials.pdf">note</a>, I describe a way of constructing a Riemann surface \(S\) with a holomorphic differential \(\omega\) defined on \(S\), so that \(\omega\) is naturally described in terms of the Weierstrass \(\wp\) function. I have the niggling suspicion that all such pairs \((S,\omega)\) may be constructed using similar Weierstrass \(\wp\)-functions based constructions, but my complex analysis isn't quite up to scratch for me to know how to tackle this. I suspect that I'll need to prove a uniformization theorem of sorts for this to be plausible.
    </p>
    
    <h4>A strange type of group cohomology</h4>
    
    <p>In this <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_de%20rham%20group%20cohomology.pdf">pdf</a>, I describe a weird type of group homology that philosophically regards an arbitrary abstract group \(G\) as a Lie group and then tries to do some sort of deRham cohomology on \(G\). I haven't touched this in a while, but I think that some classical group theoretic invariants are encoded as cohomologies in this way. I really should take another look at this...
    </p>
    
    <h3>Less crack-pot ideas</h3>
    
    <h4>Uniformisation of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</h4>
    
    <p>Uniformisation is magical, and I'm reasonably convinced that there should be a way to uniformize a smoothly bordered Riemann surface \(S\) to produce an interval's worth of (normalised) constant curvature surface metrics \(\{g_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}\) compatible with the complex structure of \(S\), so that \(g_0\) is a hyperbolic surface with \(0\) boundary geodesic curvature and \(g_1\) is a flat metric with constant (negative) constant boundary geodesic curvature. If anyone feels that they're decent with elliptic partial differential equations with (fairly simple) nonlinear boundary conditions, PLEASE CONTACT ME.</p>
    
    <h4>Teichm&uuml;ller theory of hyperbolic surfaces with right-angled borders</h4>
    
    <p>In Chapter 2 of my PhD <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_moduli%20spaces%20of%20surfaces%20(phd%20thesis).pdf">thesis</a>, I describe the Teichm&uuml;ller space and the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces with ideal points on their (geodesic) borders. It turns out that these guys are still naturally symplectic via the Weil-Petersson form that I define, although they do wind up having infinite volume. I'm reasonably confident that something like this should hold also for Teichm&uuml;ller spaces and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with broken geodesic borders which are broken at right-angles. Although, there's some need to constrain the boundary lengths somehow to retain the symplecticness.</p>
    
    <h4>A new expression for the Weil-Petersson form</h4>
    
    <p>Also in my <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_moduli%20spaces%20of%20surfaces%20(phd%20thesis).pdf">thesis</a>, I describe generalised \(\lambda\)-length coordinates for the (hypercycle-decorated) Teichm&uuml;ller space of (close geodesic) bordered hyperbolic surfaces. Using these coordinates, I can, for the once-punctured torus \(S_{1,1}\), construct a mapping class group invariant 2-form on the decorated Teichm&uuml;ller space \(\hat{\mathcal{T}}(S_{1,1},L)\). Unfortunately, it's not the Weil-Petersson form. So, I really really really want to bash out the actual Weil-Petersson form and compare the two.</p>
    
    <h4>Generalising Markoff's (quadratic forms) theorem</h4>
    
    <p>In <a href="pdfs/yi%20huang_(reading)%20series_the%20geometry%20of%20markoff%20numbers.pdf">this</a>, I skim through the basics for how the geometry of a particular 1-cusped torus may be used to derive a characterisation theorem for quadratic forms (by Markoff). At the end of this short note, I give a slight generalisation of this theorem obtained by conjugating the specific monodromy representation used in the proof of the result. I suggest two potential ideas for further generalising this result - the first involves using a different 1-cusped tori, and the second method is based on possibly using the geometry of 3-cusped projective planes (which are surprisingly similar to 1-cusped tori, as highlighted in Chapter 4 of my thesis) to obtain analogous results.
